# hyperobject_ontology

tools for analyzing, cataloging, and describing video collections through the lens of hyperobject ontologies. This project helps organize and understand video documentation of hyperobjects by creating structured ontologies with generative descriptions.

## Overview

The repository consists of several tools that work together to:
1. Map and extract metadata from video files in a structured directory
2. Generate a cartographic diagram of the video collection
3. Generate descriptions using GPT-4o vision model
4. Organize videos by hyperobject categories and spatial orientations

## Components

### Core Scripts

- `ontology_map.py`: Creates a structured JSON database of video files by:
  - Scanning the Generados directory recursively
  - Extracting video metadata (dimensions, duration, fps)
  - Organizing files by category and orientation (Hor/Ver)
  - Saving complete metadata to ontology_map.json

- `cartography_diagram.py`: Generates a cartography diagram by:
  - Organizing videos by categories and orientations
  - Computing total and mean video durations per category
  - Generating detailed orientation breakdowns
  - Creating ASCII tree diagrams with random decorative symbols
  - Displaying total collection statistics (video count and duration)
  - Saving human-readable visualizations to cartography_diagram.txt

- `hyperobject_annotator.py`: Augments the ontology metadata with generative descriptions by:
  - Extracting middle frames from videos
  - Using GPT-4o for visual analysis
  - Generating contextual descriptions
  - Saving progress incrementally to annotated_ontology.json

- `ho_master.py`: Manages distributed video playback system (Work in Progress):
  - Creates a network of synchronized video players
  - Coordinates video playback across multiple displays
  - Handles tag-based video selection and distribution
  - Manages socket connections with slave players
  - Currently supports up to 3 slave displays

- `ho_slave.py`: Individual video player node (Work in Progress):
  - Receives video assignments from master node
  - Handles local video playback using pygame/ffpyplayer
  - Maintains unique ID for master-slave communication
  - Reads video metadata from videos.json
  - Manages display settings and video rendering

### ToDo

~~1. Video Metadata Enhancement:~~ (listo)
   - Add video duration metadata to the system
   - Implement duration tracking and synchronization

2. Tag-based Playback Logic:
   - Develop intelligent video selection based on tag relations
   - Update play_video function to handle tag-based selection
   - Implement video transition logic

3. Network Communication:
   - Improve master-slave synchronization
   - Add error handling for network disconnections
   - Implement reconnection logic

4. Display Configuration:
   - Update display resolution settings (currently 640x480, planned 1920x1080)
   - Add support for different aspect ratios
   - Implement multi-display coordination

### Output Files

- `ontology_map.json`: Primary database containing:
  - Video metadata (name, path, dimensions, duration)
  - Category classifications
  - Orientation information

- `annotated_ontology.json`: Enhanced database including:
  - All metadata from ontology_map.json
  - Generated descriptions ('texto' field)
  - Incremental updates as processing continues

- `cartography_diagram.txt`:  Visualization showing:
  - Total collection metrics
  - Per-category breakdowns
  - Orientation distributions
  - Duration statistics
