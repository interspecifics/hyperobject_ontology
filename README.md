# Hyperobject Video Ontologies

A suite of Python tools for analyzing, cataloging, and describing video collections through the lens of hyperobject theory. This project helps organize and understand video documentation of hyperobjects by creating structured ontologies with AI-assisted descriptions.

## Overview

The project consists of several tools that work together to:
1. Map video files and their metadata
2. Generate statistical visualizations
3. Create AI-powered descriptions of video content
4. Organize videos by hyperobject categories and orientations

## Components

### Core Scripts

- `ontology_map.py`: Maps the video collection structure, extracting metadata and organizing files by category and orientation
- `cartography_diagram.py`: Generates statistical visualizations and tree diagrams of the video ontology
- `hyperobject_annotator.py`: Uses GPT-4o to generate descriptive annotations for videos

### Output Files

- `ontology_map.json`: Primary database of video metadata and structure
- `annotated_ontology.json`: Enhanced database including AI-generated descriptions
- `cartography_diagram.txt`: Text visualization of the ontology structure and statistics
